                            I'm Tyler! I'm a University student currently majoring in Computer Science, and minoring in Business. I've recently started to really get into
                            web development, but I love to spend my time writing all sorts of code. I'm relatively proficient with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java.
                            I have some experience with C/C++, Swift, PHP, ASP, and a little bit of Python. I have a particular interest in User Interface and User Experience design!

                            I'm always working to be original. I plan new things regularly, and try to tackle techniques and ideas that I've never
                            attempted before.

                            I'm particularly interested in user interface design. I'm a fan of simple, material design. Bright colours, simple schemes, and designs that are
                            easy to look at and navigate. My goal is to create a design that gets the message across, without the crazy, flashy effects.

                            I'm currently in University majoring in Computer Science. I've been programming for three years, but have been working with HTML and CSS
                            on and off for about ten years. I've learned to bring many of the techniques and skills learned through my University experience into
                            web development.
